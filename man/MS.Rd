\title{Characterization of the metabolic effects of Trimethyltin on a 3D mini brain
cell system data frame.}
\format{
A data frame with 36 observations and 194 variables
}
\usage{
data(MS)
}
\description{
The data frame comes from a toxicology study aiming to characterize the
metabolic effects of Trimethyltin on a 3D mini brain cell system involving
neurons and glial cells.
The experimental factors include two maturation states (immature and mature),
two exposure types (24 hours and 10 days) and three doses (0, 0.5 and 1 uM).
Three biological replicates were considered for each combination of factors
and 189 metabolites were measured.
